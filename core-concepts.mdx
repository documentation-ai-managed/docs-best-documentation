## Documentation Spaces and Organization

Organize your documentation into spaces, which act as top-level containers for projects or teams. Create a space for each product or initiative to keep content isolated and searchable.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Space" icon="plus">
    Navigate to the dashboard and select "New Space". Enter a name like "API Docs" and set permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-plus">
    Within the space, create nested pages using the sidebar. Use folders for hierarchy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Navigation" icon="menu">
    Drag pages to reorder and generate automatic sidebars.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use spaces to separate public docs from internal wikis.
</Callout>

## Content Types and Formatting

Support multiple content types including Markdown, MDX with components, and embeds. Format pages using headings, lists, and interactive elements.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Markdown Basics" icon="file">
    Start with standard Markdown for quick pages.

    ```markdown
    ## Heading

    - List item
    - Another item

    `Inline code` for variables.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MDX Components" icon="components">
    Enhance with JSX components like `<Callout>`.

    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
      ```javascript
      import { Callout } from 'best-docs/components';

      <Callout kind="info">
        Tip: Use `YOUR_API_KEY`.
      </Callout>
      ```
      ```python
      # Python example with similar structure
      print("Configure YOUR_API_KEY")
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Collaboration Features

Invite team members to spaces and assign roles like Editor or Viewer. Use comments, @mentions, and real-time previews to streamline reviews.

| Feature | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Comments | Inline feedback on pages | Review drafts |
| @Mentions | Notify contributors | Assign tasks |
| Pull Requests | Merge changes safely | Team workflows |
| History | View edit logs | Audit trails |

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Advanced Permissions" default-open="false">
    Set granular roles: Admins manage spaces, Editors publish pages, Viewers read-only access.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Version Control Basics

Integrate Git for version control. Connect your repo to auto-publish changes or use built-in versioning.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Write Page] --> B[Commit to Git]
    B --> C[Pull Request]
    C --> D[Review & Merge]
    D --> E[Publish to Space]
```

<Callout kind="alert">
  Always test changes in preview mode before publishing.
</Callout>

Track versions manually or via Git:

```bash
git add docs/core-concepts.mdx
git commit -m "Update collaboration section"
git push origin main
```

These concepts form the foundation. Apply them to build professional documentation efficiently.
